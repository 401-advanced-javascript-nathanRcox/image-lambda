# LAB - Class 17 | AWS

## Project: S3 and Lambda

## Feature Tasks

- A user should be able to upload an image at any size, and have both the original size and a thumbnail size.
- When an image is uploaded to your S3 bucket, it should trigger a Lambda function that does the following:
  - creates a 50 x 50 pixel thumbnail version of the image;
  - saves it to another S3 bucket with a predictable naming convention, so that your server and/or frontend may know where that thumbnail image resides.
